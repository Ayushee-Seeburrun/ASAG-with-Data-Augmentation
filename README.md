This is my final year project on improving automated short answer grading using data augmentation.

Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) aims to automatically evaluate and assign scores to students' short written answers. The goal is to reduce the hardwork and work pressure that is involved in manual grading especially with the growing number of students each year while also ensuring a fair and consistent assessment. 

This project explores machine learning combined with text processing and data augmentation techniques.
